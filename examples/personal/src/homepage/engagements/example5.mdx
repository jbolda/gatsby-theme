### Example 5

The podcast hosts practicing professionals, college professors and college students. The focus is providing insights into STEM professions, what is required to get through the curriculum and additional strategies to guide students towards a successful career.

I talk about how the AEC Industry is all connected. Architectural Engineering will cover all the pieces that go into actually building the building. Structural engineering, at it’s core, revolves around making sure the building and/or structure stays up.

To get through college, I express that you need to figure out during high school how you learn and also make sure to nurture your network and give value to those around you without expecting anything in return.

I recommended Asana for a to-do list and the book “Never Split the Difference” by Chris Voss.
