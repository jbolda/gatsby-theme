# `@jbolda/isolated-theme-ui-components`

## Installation
Install from npm or yarn:
```
npm install @jbolda/isolated-theme-ui-components
```
or
```
yarn add @jbolda/isolated-theme-ui-components
```

## Usage
This is primarily a small component library powered by `theme-ui`. The use of isolation between ingesting themes is still in an experimental state. The current phase will not provide isolation, and will expect a theme with specific keys and breakpoints.
